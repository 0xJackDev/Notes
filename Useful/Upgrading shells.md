## /bin/sh -i

This command will execute the shell interpreter specified in the path in interactive mode (`-i`).

#### Interactive

```shell-session
/bin/sh -i
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-4.2$
```

---

## Perl

If the programming language [Perl](https://www.perl.org) is present on the system, these commands will execute the shell interpreter specified.

#### Perl To Shell

```shell-session
perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```

```shell-session
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.

---

## Ruby

If the programming language [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is present on the system, this command will execute the shell interpreter specified:

#### Ruby To Shell

```shell-session
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.

---

## Lua

If the programming language [Lua](https://www.lua.org) is present on the system, we can use the `os.execute` method to execute the shell interpreter specified using the full command below:

#### Lua To Shell

```shell-session
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```

The command directly above should be run from a script.

## AWK

[AWK](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/awk.1p.html) is a C-like pattern scanning and processing language present on most UNIX/Linux-based systems, widely used by developers and sysadmins to generate reports. It can also be used to spawn an interactive shell. This is shown in the short awk script below:

#### AWK To Shell

```shell-session
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
```

---

## Find

[Find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) is a command present on most Unix/Linux systems widely used to search for & through files and directories using various criteria. It can also be used to execute applications and invoke a shell interpreter.

#### Using Find For A Shell

```shell-session
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
```

This use of the find command is searching for any file listed after the `-name` option, then it executes `awk` (`/bin/awk`) and runs the same script we discussed in the awk section to execute a shell interpreter.

---

## Using Exec To Launch A Shell

```shell-session
find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
```

This use of the find command uses the execute option (`-exec`) to initiate the shell interpreter directly. If `find` can't find the specified file, then no shell will be attained.

---

## VIM

Yes, we can set the shell interpreter language from within the popular command-line-based text-editor `VIM`. This is a very niche situation we would find ourselves in to need to use this method, but it is good to know just in case.

#### Vim To Shell

```shell-session
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```

#### Vim Escape

```shell-session
vim
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
```

---

## Execution Permissions Considerations

In addition to knowing about all the options listed above, we should be mindful of the permissions we have with the shell session's account. We can always attempt to run this command to list the file properties and permissions our account has over any given file or binary:

#### Permissions

```shell-session
ls -la <path/to/fileorbinary>
```

We can also attempt to run this command to check what `sudo` permissions the account we landed on has:

#### Sudo -l

```shell-session
sudo -l
