Completed100 XP

- 3 minutes

While the Microsoft Intune admin center doesn't include any reports specifically for inventory in the Reports node, you can still report on all your devices and applications using the Devices and Apps tab.

### Device reporting

To create and download a report for devices, in the Microsoft Intune admin center, do the following:

1. Select **Devices** and then select **All devices**.
2. In the **All devices** view, select the **Columns** option. Select (or deselect) any fields you wish to include in the report. Select **Apply**.
3. Select the **Filter** option. Select any other criteria you wish to set as a filter (such as OS, ownership, etc.) in the report. Select **Apply**.
4. In the **All devices** view, select **Export**.
5. Select **Yes**. A report containing all your devices with hardware inventory will be generated and downloaded to your computer, as a zipped, comma-separated value (.csv) file.
6. You can now view or modify the report in Excel.


### Application reporting

To create and download a report for apps, in the Microsoft Intune admin center, do the following:

1. Select **Apps** and then select **All apps**.
2. In the **All apps** view, select the **Columns** option. Select (or deselect) any fields you wish to include in the report. Select **Apply**.
3. Select the **Filter** option. Select any other criteria you wish to set as a filter (such as platform, assignment, app type) in the report. Select **Apply**.
4. In the **All apps** view, select **Export**.
5. Select **Yes**. A report will be generated and downloaded to your computer, as a zipped, comma-separated value (.csv) file.
6. You can now view or modify the report in Excel.

You can also download Audit logs from Intune, which provides you with a record of activities that generate a change in Microsoft Intune. Create, Update (edit), Delete, and Assign actions, or remote tasks, generate audit events that you can review. You can review audit logs for most Intune workloads. Auditing is enabled by default for all customers and can't be disabled.

To view and download Audit logs, the steps are identical to how you would create reports for hardware and apps described above. To access Audit logs, in the Microsoft Intune admin center, navigate to **Tenant administration** > **Audit logs**.

Intune provides built-in tools for reporting and monitoring compliance. These reports enable administrators to focus on situations and take action. Device compliance reports are meant to be broad in nature and provide a more traditional reporting view of data to identify aggregated metrics.

### Device compliance summary report

Use the following steps to view the Device Compliance Summary report:

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft Intune admin center**.
2. Select **Reports** > **Device Compliance** to view the reports summary.

### Device compliance report

The Device Compliance report shows all the compliance states for devices to give a broader view of the data, no matter how large the dataset. This report shows the full breakdown of records in a visualization of aggregated metrics. This report can be generated by applying filters for compliance status, OS, and type of ownership. Selecting the "Generate report" button will refresh the data to show the latest state with the ability to view the individual records that make up the aggregate data. These records can be sorted and searched upon to focus on the information you need.

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft Intune admin center**.
2. Select **Reports** > **Device compliance**.
3. In the details pane, select the **Reports** tab, then select the **Device compliance** option.
4. Select the **Compliance status**, **OS**, and **Ownership** filters to refine your report.
5. Select **Generate report** (or Generate again) to retrieve current data.

A device compliance trend report for device compliance trends can show the trend of device compliance states over a period of time. The aggregated data is displayed over a period of time, and is useful for making future investment decisions, driving process improvements, or prompting investigation into any anomalies. You can identify where compliance peaks occurred and focus your time and effort accordingly.

You can view the Trends report using the following steps:

1. Sign in to the **Microsoft Intune admin center**.
2. Select **Reports** > **Device compliance**.
3. In the details pane, select the **Reports** tab, then select the **Device compliance trends** option.

You can use the Intune DataWarehouse to build professional looking reports that provide insigh into your enterprise mobile envornment  For example, some of the reports include:

- Trend of users enrolling in Intune so you can optimize your license purchases
- App and OS versions break down so you can review that status of devices
- Enrollment and device compliance trends so you can smoothly roll out policy updates

Requirements for accessing the Intune Data Warehouse (including the API) are:

- User must be one of:
    
    - Microsoft Entra Global Administrator
    - An Intune service administrator
    - User with role-based access to Intune data warehouse resources
    - User-less authentication using application-only authentication
- Install the latest version of Power BI Desktop. You can download Power BI Desktop from: PowerBI.microsoft.com
    

When accessing data in the Data Warehouse with Power BI, you have two options:

- Load the data in Power BI using the OData link
- Use the Intune Compliance App

### Load the data in Power BI using the OData link

With a client authenticated to Microsoft Entra ID, the OData URL connects to the RESTful endpoint in the Data Warehouse API that exposes the data model to your reporting client. Follow these instructions to use Power BI Desktop to connect and create your own reports. You're not limited to Power BI Desktop, but can use your favorite analytic tool with the OData URL provided the client supports OAUTH2.0 authentication and the OData v4.0 standard.

1. Sign in to the Endpoint Manager portal and choose **Reports**.
    
2. Select **Data warehouse**. Retrieve the URL listed in the **Odata feed for reporting service** field. For example:
    
    Copy
    
    ```
    https://fef.{yourinfo}.manage.microsoft.com/ReportingService/DataWarehouseFEService/dates?api-version=beta
    
    ```
    
3. Open **Power BI Desktop**.
    
4. Choose **Home** > **Get Data**. Select **OData feed**.
    
5. Type or paste the OData URL into the URL box.
    
6. Authenticate to Microsoft Entra ID for your tenant from the Power BI desktop client by signing in on the Organizational account tab.
    
7. Select the desired tables needed for reporting.
    
8. Create custom dashboards and reports using the Power BI Desktop.
    

### Use the Power BI App

Alternatively, you can use the Power BI Intune Compliance app, which is in preview. This contains pre-configured reports focused on device compliance reporting. This uses the web version of Power BI and allows for customization and sharing of reports.

1. Sign in to the Endpoint Manager portal and choose **Reports**.
2. Select **Get Power BI App**, then **Get it now**.
3. Install the App. You'll either need to sign in with a user licensed for Power BI or sign up for a trial.
4. Once in the app, note a message that sample data is being shown. Connect your data by signing in.
5. When the data has refreshed (this can take up to 5 minutes), select the Intune Compliance workspace to view the dashboards and reports.


# Access Intune using Microsoft Graph API

Completed100 XP

- 3 minutes

The Microsoft Graph API for Intune enables programmatic access to Intune information for your tenant; the API performs the same Intune operations as those available through the Azure portal. Even though Microsoft Graph is primarily used for programmatic access to your data in the cloud, and thus can be used for building automation scripts. You can also use it to extract data from Intune and further manipulate that data into your favorite analysis or reporting tool. When you use Microsoft Graph you have access to all data in Intune but it’s more complex to work with compared to Power BI and Intune Data Warehouse, for example.

[![Illustration titled, Intune APIs in Microsoft Graph-automation, integration and advanced analytics.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/inventory-complinace-reports/media/microsoft-graph-api-907866e3.png)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/inventory-complinace-reports/media/microsoft-graph-api-907866e3.png#lightbox)

For mobile device management (MDM) scenarios, the Graph API for Intune supports standalone deployments. Intune provides data into the Microsoft Graph in the same way as other cloud services do, with rich entity information and relationship navigation. Use Microsoft Graph to combine information from other services and Intune to build rich cross-service applications for IT professionals or end users.

Here’s an example of how you can determine whether an application is installed on a user's device:

1. From Microsoft Entra ID, get a list of devices registered to a user:
    
    Copy
    
    ```
    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/{user}/ownedDevices
    
    ```
    
2. Then view the list of applications for your tenant:
    
    Copy
    
    ```
    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceAppManagement/mobileApps
    
    ```
    
3. Take the ID from the application and determine the installation state for the application (and therefore user):
    
    Copy
    
    ```
    https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceAppManagement/mobileApps/{id}/deviceStatuses/
    
    ```
    

### Microsoft Graph Explorer

You could use the Microsoft Graph Explorer, which is a tool that lets you make requests and receive responses against the Microsoft Graph. Doing so should make it easier to find out how you would build your queries against Graph for Intune. You can find the Microsoft Graph Explorer at: [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer). For examples of scripts used to access and manipulate data in Intune using Microsoft Graph, refer to the Graph API PowerShell-Intune-Sample script at: [Microsoft Graph PowerShell Intune Samples](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples).

Before using Microsoft Graph Explorer or running scripts against Microsoft Graph API, permissions must be assigned in Microsoft Entra ID to the user running the tool. Microsoft Graph controls access to resources using permission scopes. As a developer, you must specify the permission scopes you need to access Intune resources. Typically, you specify the permission scopes you need in the Microsoft Entra admin center. It's also possible to assign the required permission in Microsoft Graph Explorer if you're logged on as a Global Administrator.
