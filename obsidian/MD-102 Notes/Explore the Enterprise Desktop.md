The enterprise desktop has evolved. IT Management and Support can be a challenging task, given the dynamic nature of the IT world today. IT professionals once considered the enterprise desktop an organization-owned computer or laptop that was shared or assigned to a specific employee. Today, the enterprise desktop could be a computer, laptop, phone, or tablet. Either the company or the employee who works in an office, from home, a hotel room, or a customer site might own these devices.

Traditional management methods need help with accommodating these new scenarios. Modern endpoint management introduces new techniques and concepts for deploying and maintaining the infrastructure in such a dynamic landscape.

The enterprise deployment lifecycle is a framework for identifying the processes and tasks required to deploy and manage an organization’s desktops. This process includes the initial planning of the entire deployment lifecycle, desktop acquisition, the deployment process itself, and post-deployment management. The lifecycle also includes how you'll support the deployment process, including upgrades, and how it will eventually be retired.

## Objectives

After completing this module, you'll be able to:

- Describe the benefits of Modern endpoint management.
- Explain the enterprise desktop lifecycle model.
- Describe considerations for planning hardware strategies.
- Describe the steps in planning OS and app deployment.
- Describe considerations for post-deployment and retirement.

Until recently Managing PCs Required IT pros to do alot of manual hands on tasks. New devices and new approaches in Windows client management advancements in cloud technology and BYOD trends have made modern endpoint management more interesting for many organizations 

- Easy to deploy and manage. While powerful, traditional operating system deployment (OSD) is typically complex and time-consuming. There's now a more straightforward way to provision new Windows devices. Windows Autopilot, deeply integrated with Microsoft Entra ID and Intune, simplifies and personalizes the out-of-the-box (OOBE) user experience. Windows Autopilot joins the device to Microsoft Entra ID and enrolls it in Intune. Intune automatically applies users’ email, apps, files, preferences, and organization’s security settings without creating custom OS images.
- Always up to date. Keeping up with emerging security threats and increasing user productivity requires changing how often Windows and Microsoft 365 apps need to be updated. With aligned updates, powerful insights driven by cloud intelligence, and a modern endpoint management approach with Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS), there's now a better way to keep devices up to date without the complexity of maintaining an on-premises infrastructure.
- Intelligent security, built in. Attackers are becoming more sophisticated, so Microsoft 365 was designed with security in mind. Microsoft built many new and growing security features directly into the Microsoft 365 platform, including Windows Hello, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Windows Information Protection, Microsoft Entra Identity Protection, Conditional Access, and more. These security features powered by Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph, use billions of signals and constantly improve machine-learning algorithms. Intelligent Security Graph provides human expertise to help you protect your company data and respond to sophisticated attacks.
- Proactive insights. With rich telemetry and cloud intelligence, you can proactively discover device and app issues before they affect end users. You can be more confident when applying OS updates, finding security issues, and more. The fusion between machine intelligence and human expertise can create a unique and powerful partnership.


IT departments must be able to meet user reqiurments. The technologies must be flexible and able to support an envionment where work styles change rapidly a cross different devices and locations. Additionally companies often Expect IT departments to do more to improve business efficiency with few resources.

 An established device life cycle ensures organizations have the right technologies in place for users to remain productive. The life-cycle also ensures that when devices have reached end-of-life, they don't become a liability. In today's environment, where users frequently use personal devices, they also become part of that life cycle.

Organizations constantly manage the different phases of the enterprise desktop life cycle. These phases include:

- **Planning:** Preparing defining a strategy for system management.
- **Purchasing:** Processing requisitions, and then obtaining approval of invoices for payment.
- **Deployment:** Installing an operating system, enrolling devices, and deploying applications to the device.
- **Operations:** Ensuring that systems are functioning properly and are protected.
- **Support:** Ensuring that the end users learn how to use their systems and applications, and receive the support they need.
- **Upgrade and Retire:** This phase includes replacing devices, retiring obsolete hardware, or unenrolling a device from the organization.
