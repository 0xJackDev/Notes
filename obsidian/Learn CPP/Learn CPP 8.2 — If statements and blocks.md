The first category of control flow statements we’ll talk about is conditional statements. A **conditional statement** is a statement that specifies whether some associated statement(s) should be executed or not.

C++ supports two basic kinds of conditionals: `if statements` (which we introduced in lesson [4.10 -- Introduction to if statements](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-if-statements/), and will talk about further here) and `switch statements` (which we’ll cover in a couple of lessons).
