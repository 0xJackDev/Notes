When debugging a problem the vast majority of your time will be spend trying to find the error.




1. Figure out how to reproduce the problem
2. Run the program and gather information to narrow down where the problem is
3. Repeat the prior step until you find the problem



If a software issue is blatant (e.g. the program crashes in the same place every time you run it) then reproducing the problem can be trivial. However, sometimes reproducing an issue can be a lot more difficult. The problem may only occur on certain computers, or in particular circumstances
