the **Remember**: It's possible to formulate the following rules based on this result:

- when **both** `**` arguments are integers, the result is an integer, too;
- when **at least one** `**` argument is a float, the result is a float, too.


the ** is Exponentiation so 
print((2 ** 4) would just be 2 to the fourth power

(2 ** 3 ** 2)

in an expression with ** it is actually worked on right to left so first you would do 3 to the 2nd power which would equal 9 and then you would do 2 to the 9th power which equals 512 which is a stupid as mind fuck and another reason i hate python

All the other operators are LEFT SIDE binding EXCEPT exponents are right side binding which is fucking STUPID

the // operator is Floor division which always rounds up from the fraction

The result of integer divsion is always rounded to the nearest integer value that is less than the real not rounded result. 

ROUNDING ALWAYS GOES TO THE LESSER INTEGER


Note: some of the values are negative. This will obviously affect the result. But how?

The result is two negative twos. The real (not rounded) result is `-1.5` in both cases. However, the results are the subjects of rounding. The **rounding goes toward the lesser integer value**, and the lesser integer value is `-2`, hence: `-2` and `-2.0`.
