Phishing hasa become a major problem whether this is SMS phishing over text or email there needs to be an easy way to report phishing websites with one click. Usually this process involves finding the domain register the VPS company hosting the website and reporting to both manaually. I want to Make a website that will automate the sending of emails. The problem i forsee with this is if i link my own email this could in turn be used to send malicious or spam emails from my domain so maybe just making something that will give u a crafted email to send and to who. 

Integrate this with an WHOIS api to find domain registrar. Then Craft an Email With Chat gpt via the API. and return this to the user. Must find a way to do this as well with the VPS company.
