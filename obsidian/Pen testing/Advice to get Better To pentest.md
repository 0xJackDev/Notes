Think about why I need to add value to a company

Best way to look at things is Think about how the website is meant to behave look at the login page. think about how the Application behavior. For example if your logging in your gonna be sending a SQL command sod think about what columns and rows they are pulling from.

Different Types of XSS

Stored XSS

REfleced XSS

Dynamic XSS:

ESSENTIALLY ALL THE SAME THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS DEPENDING ON WHERE THE VALUE IS 

if you can enter a value on a page you essentially just need to check if you can run your own HTML on the page

for example if a look on a webapage and i see my value is being put inside a HTML attribute for example

1. `<element attribute="any_value"></element>`
    

Message Code With Me

if i can put any value in there for example 

1. `<element attribute="Pirate"></element>`
    

All i would need to be is change my username is a "" like 

1. `<element attribute="""></element>` (edited)
    

i can essentially put any command after the "" 

1. `<element attribute="X"></element>` (edited)
    
if x = "><script>alert(location)</script><nothing nothing="">

All XSS is where the parameter is How i can Execute my own HTML/Javascript


Stored XSS is when you get javascript to execute when it pulls it from the database

Reflective XSS is when the Javascript executes in the URL of the webpage and theres no way anyone else can run they javascript unless they ran something in like  a search bar

Dumb XSS: this just means they have javascript stored in the site and you can put any value into that javascript document.write function so if you can put your own code in THEIR JAVASCRIPT FILES
