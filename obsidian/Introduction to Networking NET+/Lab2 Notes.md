Peer-to-peer network – a network type where two or more computers share resources (such as files or printers) and each computer in the network is responsible for their own access and security. These networks are simpler and cheaper than client/server networks but are less efficient when many users exist or large amounts of resources need to be shared

Client/server network – a network where one centralized computer (called a server) controls access and security to shared resources. Other computers (called clients) connect to this central server to access shared resources

Simple file sharing – a wizard-based file sharing method that enables non-technical users the ability to easily share files over the network

Advanced file sharing – a file sharing method used by administrators to provide more granular control of shared files over the network

Universal Naming Convention (UNC) – a standard for identifying shared resources over the network. The UNC path uses double backslashes to precede the computer name then single backslashes to separate the shared path to the resource. UNC names do not use drive letters to identify resources

Permissions – the rights granted to a user or group to access a resource

New Technology File System (NTFS) – the primary Windows file system. NTFS includes its own set of file/folder permissions.

Line Print Terminal (LPT) – the logical named assigned to the parallel port on a PC. Parallel ports were typically used to attach local printers although they have become obsolete and replaced with USB

Universal Serial Bus (USB) – a type of serial interface that is used to connect peripheral devices to a PC

HyperText Markup Language (HTML) – the language used for documents on the World Wide Web

HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) – the protocol used to transfer web files over the Internet. HTTP uses TCP port 80 for initiating requests

Universal Resource Locator (URL) – the named address of a resource on the Internet

Domain Name System (DNS) – the protocol used to map hostnames and domain names into IP address on the Internet. DNS uses UDP port 53 for initiating requests

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) – the protocol used to send and receive files from another computer on the Internet. FTP uses TCP port 21 to set up the exchange process and TCP port 20 to exchange the actual data

Internet Information Services (IIS) – Microsoft’s web server
