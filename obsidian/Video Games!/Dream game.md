    Make a co-op Horror game that allows you to talk to the monster via either Voice input or Text input and the monster will have custom responses Powered By Chat Gpts Api. I need ideas for this game but that will be the backbone. You have to comminicate with the monster and get him to get you through levels without killing you.

    - Cons of making game powered by chat gpt. if i use voice input im gonna need a realible way to translate voice into text.
    - Gonna need some way to manage Api keys without hardcoding them
    
    -If the AI is gonna speak in the game im gonna need a voice actor to Power it but i cant imagine everything it would possibly say so i need to give chat gpt a list of prompts it can use.
