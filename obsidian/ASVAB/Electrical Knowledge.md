Electron flow Theory.
Electron flow theory describes the behavior of electrons when moving through a conductor. Negatively Charged electrons in a circuit flow from the negative terminal (anode) to the positive terminal (cathode) electrons flow in this manner in response to the attractive and repulsive forces between charges Particles.

Atoms, Protons, Neutrons, Electrons, Valence Shell

All matter is composed of atoms. Atoms display different properties depending on the composition of the atom. They are composed of smaller particles called protons, electrons, and neutrons. A single proton is an element known as hydrogen. The addition of another proton results in a new element helium. If instead there are a different number of neutrons in the nucleus it is known an isotope that's why you can have the same element but a different isotope.

The three particles in a atom differ in interesting ways: protons and electrons are oppositely charged and neutrons do not contain a charge. Electrons are negatively charged, Protons are Positively charged.

Electrons are much smaller than protons and neutrons and exist around the nucleus inside of energy orbitals. These energy orbitals surround the nucleus and depending upon the number of electrons and their distance from the atomic nucleus. These electrons fartherst from the nucleus are the most reactive


Conductor, SemiCondutor, And Insulator.

Conductivity Measures the easy in which electrons can flow through a material. Metals are good conductors because electrons flow easily through them without much resistance. Copper is an excellent example of an conductor. Copper wire conducts current with little resistance.

Materials exhibiting very low conductivity are called insulators. Insulators possess high resistivity. Rubber is a good example of an insulator thats why many tools used in electrical works have rubber coated handles.

Semiconductors have conduct ivies that are between those of conductors and Insulators. Unlike conductors which experience increased resistance when heated, semiconductors increase in conductivity when heated. Graphite which is used to make many resistors is a good example of a semiconductor.

Current

Current is the rate at which charges flow through a conductor in an electrical circuit. It is measured in coulombs per second, or amps. Current, voltage and resistance are all related to each other in ohms law.

Current = Voltage / Resistance

Voltage 

Voltage is the electrical potential difference between two charged points in an electric fields. Because it is a difference in potential Voltage is only meaningful when considered in relation to one another and is measured in volts.

Voltage = Current * Resistance

Voltage is also referred to as electromotive force, as it is the force responsible for driving the current through a ciruit. It can be likened in pressure because there is a higher concertation of charge at one point then another.

Resistance

Resistance is an inherent property of materials that hinders the passage of current through a conductor. resistance and conductance are inversely related; a very conductive material has little resistance and a very resistive material has little conductance. Resistance is measured in ohms

Materials vary in resistance because of the easy ( or difficulty with which electrons in the materials atom can be displaced.) resistance is also linked to the cross sectional area and length of material used; the larger the area the lesser the resitence the longer the conductor the greater.

The equation to solve for resistance is 
R=⍴⋅LA 
where _⍴⍴_ represents the resistivity of the conducting material, _L_ is the length, and _A_ is the cross-sectional area.
or 
Resistance = Voltage / Current

Also a little tip is if you are given Voltage divide voltage by whatever else you are given to find it if you are calculating voltage just multiply the two numbers together to get it

Circuits

Series circuits: in a series circuit the components are connected from end to end 1 after another, they make a simply loop for the current to flow around

In a Parallel circuit the components are connected side by side so the current divides some going one way and another going another way 

The voltage is the measure of the electric push the battery gives to the electrons, its a measure of energy in joules.
Each packet of electrons is called  Coulombs (C) 

The voltmeter measures Joules per Coulombs or VOLTS!!!

Voltmeters are ALWAYS connected in Parallel when added to a circuit 

We can also measure the current flowing through a circuit.

In a wire the current  is the flow of negatively charged electrons we can imagine it being like water flowing in a pipe but instead of water its Negatively flowing Electrons that we measure in Coulombs. So  electric Current is measured as Coulombs per seconds or more commonly AMPS measured using a Ammeter which must be connected in series.

Resistance is the measure of resistance to current flow in a electronic circuit. 
Resistance is measured in Ohms (Ω). The higher the resistance the more difficult it is for a current to flow. 

A good way to think about electricity is Voltage pushing the current around and resistance is as if the Pipe Holding the current narrows For components Connected in series The total voltage is measured with the equation 

Equations for Series circuits
V(voltage) = V1 + V2: this is because the power supply is shared between the components 
I(current)  = I1 + I2:
R(resistance) = R1 + R2

So for Series circuits Voltage equals all of the Cells added up and SO does current and so does resistance


Equations for Parallel circuits the Voltage between total components is the same between each one so
V = V1 = V2 
I = I1 + I2 
1/R = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3**

Remember after you calculate the fraction to flip it 


Resistance is less than the resistance of the lowest individual resistor 

Each cell provides a potential different 

1/10 + 1/5 = 3/10 or .3 So resitance = 10/3 = 3.333
