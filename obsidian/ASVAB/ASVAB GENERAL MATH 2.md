How to divide fractions

1. First If you have an Mixed fraction you must convert it to an improper fraction 
2.  The Rules for Dividing fractions is Keep, Change, Flip.
3. So you keep the first fraction the same, Then you Flip the Multiplication/Division to Be the other so if its Multiplication it turns into Division and division into multiplication. And then you flip the Fraction in which you are dividing by, by flipping the numerator my the denominator.
4. Sometimes these fractions can be relatively large and multiplying by them can be a little difficult so SIMPLIFY BEFORE YOU MULTIPLY!
5. In multiplication take this for example 
45        7
--   x     --
14        30

Since 45 x 7 and 7 x 45 are the same you can convert the problem to 

7        45
--   x    --
14        30

which when multiplied

45
--
60 

which simplifies to 3/4

Note THIS  ONLY WORKS WITH Dividing fractions as when you are multiplying fractions you are actually Dividing so it matters which number is being divided by which




When multiplying exponents with the same base just add the exponents together
