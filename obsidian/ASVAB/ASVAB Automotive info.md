the purpose of a crankshaft is to convert the linear motion of pistons into a rotational motion

Engine displacement is the combined volume of all the cylinders in the engine or the combined volume of the air/fuel used in one complete engine cycle

A turbo charger blows compressed air and fuel into the cylinders during the intake cycle

In an automatic transmission the functional equivalent to a clutch is the torque converter

the differential is responsible for allowing the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds and performs the final gear reduction between the transmission rotation speed and the wheels
