How to divide Decimals.

Lets start with some example for example 7 / 0.4 

In order to divide this fraction first we must look at this is as a fraction so
7
--     =   
0.4 

But this is also a hard way to cospecialize, so another way to read the fraction 0.4 would be 4/10th.  How do you get rid of a decimal in the 10th place? well you multiply it by 10, however if you must multiply 7 by 10 as well turning this problem into 
70 
--
4

which = 17.5 and that is the answer to 7 / 0.4

But you might think oh thats simple all I have to do is multiple by 10. NO!!!! if you are not in the tenth place for example say ou have the problem 7 / 0.04. Now that 0.04 is in the Hundreth place and they both must be multiple by 100 so that you can work with whole numbers so 
700
-----
4

and this would actually equal 175 so 7 / 0.04 is 175

Also I want you to remember JACK that anything divided by itself is 1. so 5.4 / 5.4 is just = 1

The golden rule is whatever u do to the top you must do the bottom.

If a number does not evenly add up make sure to work out all the options to make sure yours makes the most sense

Now let us try an even more advanced problem for example 7.6/1.52 first lets change this fraction lets multiply by 100 so making the problem

760
-----
152 


make sure when doing long division that the number you are seeing how many times you are going into goes on the outside and the number that is being divided is on the inside so in 7.8 / 2.5. 2.5 would be on the outside and 7.8 on the inside.
Also remember when you have a remainder in long division to subtract whatever the number you could reach down and subtract it by the number you are dividing. then bring down a 0 if it is not divisible. make sure you keep the decimal in the right place up top though.



Factoring Trinomial the easy way.

also when you see x² without a number before it that means that the number is only 1 as there is only 1 x

so lets look at the problem

x² + 5x + 6

In this problem the leading coefficient  is 1. And the end Coefficent is 6.
When you see this you must find two numbers that multiply to 6 but add to the middle term 5 for example 3 and 2 muliply to 6 but add to 5. 1.

so Simply put the answer is gonna be 
(x+2) (x+3) 

so another problem would be x² + 8 + 15
=
(x + 3) (x+ 5)


x² - 7x + 12

(x - 3) (x - 4)

x² + 3x - 40

(x - 5) (x + 8)

so thats assuming that x² is 1 and not for example 2x² lets solve those problems
How could we solve for x in this problem? 
2x² - 3x - 2 = 0

The first thing we are gonna do is multiply the first and the last term so 2x *  -2 which equals - 4 so we have now 2(-2) = -4. We need to find two numbers  that multiply to -4 but add to the middle number -3 so the answer would be 
(x - 4) (x+1) but we still have not solved for x so now lets replace the -3x with the equation 
2x² - 4x + 1x  -2 = 0
so and to solve for x lets use grouping so in the first group lets use the GCF so
What's the greatest common factor of 2 and -4? in this case it is 2x in order to find out what goes inside the parenthesis we must divide 2x² / 2x which simply equals x and then you will divide -4x by 2x which equals -2.  Now theres no GCF between 2x and 1 so in that case we will just put +1 
2x(x - 2) + 1 (x - 2)
Usually if the two numbers you have above at this point are the same it means you are going in the right direction

So now lets remove (x-2) on both sides leaving the answer as 
(x-2) (2x+ 1) = 0 



How to calculate the percent of a number.

First problem is 11% of 144. The way that you wanna read this problem is really like the percent * the orignal number = Result in this case 144 so. 11 * 144 =

   144
x   .11
----------
15.84


lets work another problem. 

   45.7
x  0.74
----------

Since there is one decimal place in 45.7 and
