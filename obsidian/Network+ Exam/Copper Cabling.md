Copper cabling is the foundation of our Ethernet networks. If you have a network at home you are usually connecting with copper cabling. 

Whenever building out networks we need to make sure we get the correct type of cable for the type of network we are installing 

Anything that we plug into our network will ultimately come back to that wired connection 

Twisted Copper Cable

If you are to look inside any of our ethernet cables you would see four pairs of wires and you would see that the pairs are twisted around each other, These wires are sending equal and opposite signals down both sides of the wire sometimes this is refered to as Transmit+, Transmit - or Recieve + and Recieve - 


The reason for sending these opposite signals down the same wires is that we are taking advantage of the twist, because the wires twisted it is always moving away from any noise or interference that may be occuring anywhere close to the cable. This allows us to compare those signals on the other end and reconstruct what may have been damaged or interfered with during the transmission and be able to properly receive the total signal. 

The different pairs also have different twist rates which is another way we can use to reconstruct that signal on the other side 



Copper Cable Categories


There are different ways to construct twisted pair cabling and different cables itself. these different tables of cables are called categories of tables and we use these cables to determine which type of table we use for which network ![[Screenshot 2024-07-02 195624.png]]



Coaxial Cables


Not all cable connections are twisted pair though sometimes you may be using coaxial cable, coaxial meaning you have two or things using the same form or that share a common axis and in this case it is a single wire conductor  that's used in this particular coax cable. Usually if you look at a Coax cable thats on the back of a television or anywhere its gonna be a RG-6 this is what we use for Internet connectivity and Digital internet connections this is commonly what you would use for television and for your cable modem connections 




Twinaxial Cables 

Twinax is similar to coax except instead of having one single conductor inside the cable there are two separate conductors, or twins. This is the cable you would commonly see associated with 10 Gig ethernet over copper specifically using SFP transceivers, this allows for full duplex connection because you do have two connections one for send and one for receive, but it does a limited distance when used with 10 gig Ethernet of about 5 meters, Low Cost, And Low latency



Structured cabling standards:
one thing you will notice working from company to company is that all of their wiring and everything that's connected inside their network is identical from location to location. this is by design. there are a set of standards on exactly how you should install and use these twisted pair and copper connections, these are the International ISO/IEC 11801 Cabling Standards
Inside of north America you will commonly see the telecommunication industry associate (TIA) standards. Specifically the ANSI/TIA-568 standard which is the commercial building Telecommunication cabling standards
This is extensive we will talk about the standards of Pin and pair assignments of eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling Specifcally we are gonna talk about the T568A and T568B standard 



T568A and T568B standards dictate what type of colors we will use when punching down  these ethernet connections the T568A has a different set of colors then the T568B standard but by using either the A or B standard we can be assured we are matching a standard used elsewhere the standards mention times to use T568A and times to use T568B but really many organizations just us T568B but normally an organization will pick either one or the other 



there are differences between T568A and T568B so its important you know which standard you are using on both ends and that they are the same. 
the T568A or B standard is not related to Ethernet crossover. Crossover cables are defined in the IEE 802.3 and not the 568 standard 

Here are the colors used for these two standards ![[Screenshot 2024-07-02 202048.png]]
