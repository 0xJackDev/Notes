If you work on a network for any amount of time you will run into a scenario where you need a fiber connection and all you have is a copper connection, or vice versa in order to create the type of connection you need you may need to use a 

Media Converter:
this is a device that operates at OSI layer 1 and converts the signals of one media type to the signals of another media type. For example you could extend a copper wire over a long distance by converting that connection to fiber for the long distance then back to copper when needed. 


This is almost always powered, especially with fiber to copper





Transceiver:
This term means that there is a Transmitter and a receiver usually inside of a single component, 
this is a modular interface that allows you to plug in exactly the type of connection you would like to use. Meaning no matter what you are needing to use you should be able to plug in the proper transceiver and make that connection. 
There are many different types and designs of transceivers.



DUPLEX TRANSCEIVERS
With most of these transceivers youll commonly see two separate fibers used for this connection. One of thse fibers would be the transmit fiber, and the other fiber the Receive fiber. 
So if you are connecting transceivers then you have one fiber that is using the Receive side and of the transceiver and plug into the transmit side of the other, and vise versa on the other. 



Bi-Directional (BiDi) Transceivers 
there may be limited number of fibers on a connection and in this case you may  want to use a BiDi transceiver which allows your traffic to run in both directions with a single fiber. 




SFP and SFP+ 


Small Form-Facor Pluggable (SFP). This is a small connector 
- commonly used to provide 1 G/b Fiber
- 1 Gig RJ45 SFP works too


Theres an enhanced version of SFP called SFP+ which is basically the same thing but its faster
- Supports date rates up to 16 Gbs 
- common with 10 gb internet






QSFP 

Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable 

This is slightly larger then a traditonal SFP but it supports 4 times the information. 
This is a four channel SFP meaning you can have four different 1 Gigabit connections or have 4 Gb in a single connection.

Just how SFP has SFP plus QSFP has QSFP+ that has four channels but instead of four channels of SFP it has four channels of SFP+ so you can easily fit four 10 Gigabit = 40 gigabit a second in total


This saves cost as you can combine four SFPs into a single piece of equipment 

you can also use Bi directional QSFP and QFSP and help with efficiency over a single fiber run.
