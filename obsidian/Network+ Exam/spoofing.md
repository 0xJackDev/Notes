If there is a device on your network pretending to be a completely different device this is what is referred to as spoofing 
- They could create a fake web server, Fake being a DNS server, etc



Email address spoofing:
- The sending address of an email isnt really the sender



Caller ID spoofing:
- The incoming call information is completely fake 

On-path attacks:
- the person in the middle of the conversion pretends to be a endpoint or both endpoints 




ARP poisoning (IP spoofing):






IP address spoofing: 
- this is pretending to be someone else's IP 
- This could be legitimate as like for example Load balancers pretends that they are an IP address but in reality there's multiple IP addresses providing the service 
- May also not be legitimate, they could be DDoSing or performing ARP poising 




MAC spoofing:
- Your ethernet device has a MAC address burned into it
- Although its burned into the ROM of the device many driver of the network interface card allow you to modify that MAC address to be whatever you want
