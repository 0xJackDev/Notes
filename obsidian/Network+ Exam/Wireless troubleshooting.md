Wireless performance
- Performance can vary on a wireless network depending on a number of variables 


one way to measure this performence is by measuring throughput



Theres a standard for measuring the signal youve recieved on a device its refered to as 


RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) 
- this is the strength of a received radio signal
-  Measured in deibel-milliwats (dBm)
	- The number of decibals with reference to one milliwat
	- The closer to zero is better
	- Shown  as a negative number 
	- -50 is amazing
	- -70 is good
	- anything lower then -80 dBm is a bad signal



you can commonly collect these values using a wireless survey tool




we dont only have to be concerned about the signals we receive, we also have to be worried about the signals we sound out which is measure din 

EIRP (Effective isotropic radiated power):
- This is the signal strength we have been sending from our devices
- Calculated by taking out transmit strength + antenna gain - cable loss = EIRP.
- in the united states, transmission power is regulated by the FCC (Federal Communications commission)
- For 2.4 GHz the maximum EIRP is +36 dBm or 4W 
- This varies based on connections and frequencies used 
- This is sometimes configurable on the access point 





antenna configuration:

Polarization
- this is the orientation of the antenna as relative to the surface of the earth 
- The orientation of the antenna, is it pointing up? 
- You wanna make sure that the Transmitting and receiving polarization should be the same, if the polarization is offset only part of the signal will be received 








one measurement of efficiency of your access point is 


AP association time:
devices must associate with an access point, this could occur multiple times as a device roams







Channel utilization:
in very dense networks there's a problem with the number of people using the access points, and delays associated with this.

There's a limited amount of frequency on a access point and when you reach a large number of users, you may be using all of this frequency 

Most access points can monitor utilization and when you hit 100% you've used all your available wireless space 






Managing channel utilization:
There's a number of settings you can enable to make this conversation more efficient. If you have the access point set to legacy mode or low speed support then disable those functions so it runs at the highest speed

You may also wanna make sure that is no other devices that could be interfering with the frequencies you are using, Avoid overlapping


If there is overlapping you may want to adjust the output power to avoid conflicts with other access points 

- you may need to split the network so if one access points get overrun you can have a separate access point with a complete different set of frequencies to backup it 




Site surveys:
- this is why site surveys are very important to determine an existing wireless land space 
- Identify existing access points, you may not control those
- Work around existing frequencies
