On the internet we have a format process on how IP addresses are assigned this usualyl starts with the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)
Who send blocks of IP address ranges to RIRs (regional Internet Registries) 
RIRs assign smaller subnet blocks to ISPs 

And the ISP assigns you as the costumer with an IPv6 address that is associated with a /48 subnet 





Lets say ur a customer of that ISP and you have to subnet:

Lets say youve been assigned 2600:DDDD:1111 Now its up to you to subnet this further based on ur requirements this is an IPV6 address thats been created based on this requirements ![[Screenshot 2024-07-12 221711.png]]


And if we wanted to have more Subnets we could simple change the value in the middle where locally assigned is
With those 16 subnet bits u can create OVER 65K TOTAL SUBETS WITH ABOUT 18 TRILLION POSSIBLE HOSTS ON EACH SUBNET but obviously you wouldnt put that many on a subnet its
