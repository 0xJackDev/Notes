By far Ethernet is by far the most popular networking technology. To be able to make these ethernet connections work we use many different cables many different connectors and equipment. 

Modern Ethernet uses Twisted pair copper or fiber

One common technology shared across is baseband technology this means there is a single frequency that's using the entire medium. That means across this wired connection or fiber connection we are using a single type of frequency to be able to transmit these signals, this is different then broadband connectivity, In broadband you have a single wire but you are sending many different frequencies across the wire.



ETHERNET TECHNOLOGIES

If you have some older 10 and 100 megabit ethernet you are probably using
10BASE-T 
10 Megabit
-this stands for Two pair
-Category 3 cable Minimum
- 100 Meter max






100Base-TX
100 Megabit
-Fast Ethernet
-Two Pair
-Category 5 Minimum 
- 100 Meter max




1000BASE-T
1000 Megabit 
- 4 pair Balanced twisted pair
This is known as Gigabit Ethernet over Cat 5
-4 Pair balanced Twisted pair
- 100 meter max
Category 5 is now deprecated so we use cat 53 today instead







10GBASE-T

10 Gig Ethernet Over copper
- 4 pair balanced Twisted-pair

We are using frequencies of 500 megahertz this increased frequency rate translates into more data being sent across the connection 

You need a minimum of A Category 6 cable to use 10g and if you are using an unshielded cable the max supported distance is 55 meters if shielded then 100 meters


Category 6A cables can also be used.






40GBASE-T
40 Gigabit per second ethernet
- 4-pair balanced twisted-pair

- Category 8 cable
- Up to 30 meters 





100 megabit ethernet over Fiber Standard

100BASE-FX
-pair of multimode fiber
-commonly uses laser 
- 2 Kilometers max 




100BASE-SX
-Less expensive version of Fiber 100 megabit ethernet.
- Uses LED optics
- 300 meters max





Gigabit ethernet over fiber

1000Base-SX
-Gigabit ethernet using short wavelength laser
-Usually over multi-mode fiber
-220 to 550 meters depending on fiber



1000BASE-LX
-Gigabit ethernet using long wavelength laser
-Multimode fiber to 550 meters
-Single-mode fiber to 5 kilometers 









10 Gigabit ethernet over fiber

10GBASE-SR -- Short Range
-Multimode fiber
-26 to 400 meters


10GBASE-LR -- Long range
-Single mode fiber 
- up to 10 Kilometers 







WDM 
Wavelength-Division Multiplexing

This technology allows us to over bidirectional communication over a single stranded fiber for multiple types of signals 

This uses different wavelengths for each carrier, think of this of sending different colors over the same stand of fiber. One common type of WDM is 

Coarse Wavelength-Division (CWDM)  This is the same 10GBASE-LX4 Standard uses four 3.125 Gb/sec Carriers at four different wavelength

Dense Wavelength-Division (CWDM)  multiplex multiple OC carries into a single fiber. You can up to 160 Signals and increase the thruput to 1.6 terabits per second![[Screenshot 2024-07-05 003153.png]]
