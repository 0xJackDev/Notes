Floor plans:
- this is a overlay of the wired and wireless network with the existing architectural layout 
- This includes wires in the ceiling/floor and access point locations 
- This can be useful for patch panel labels to or to associate a desk with a number
- Can be used for planning

Physical Network Maps
- This follows the physical wire and device

Distribution frame:
 if you look at the backwall of a data center you may notice a huge wall of wires and punch down blocks. This is a Distribution frame: and its a way to terminate all wires and cables in a room to make it much easier to manage as you're connecting to other devices.
 - set of punch down blocks or patch panels 
 - This is a good place to bring in all network connections which makes it easy when you need to extend those network connections 








Main Distribution Frame (MDF):
- This is the central point of a network, Usually in a data center 
- This is a termination point for Wide area network links to connect the Inside network to the outside network
- Makes a good test point to test network traffic in both directions
- This is often the Main data center






Intermediate Distribution Frame (IDF):
In larger building you will need a midpoint between the users desk and the Data center. this midpoint is the IDF
- This is a extension of the MDF 
- This connects the users to the Network and uplinks to the MDF
- Common in medium to large organizations




Logical network maps:
sometimes you don't need to see a direct wired connections but its useful to get a overall view of connectivity for the organization. you can create this using software like Visio, OmniGraffle or Gliffy.com

Managing your cables:
As network admins we also need to document all of the cables in our organization there is a standard for this documentation called 
- ANSI/TIA/EIA 606 - Administration Standard for the Telecommunications Infrastructure of Commercial Buildings
- This helps for presentation of information
- And helps on how to document the pathway, space and grounding
- Cables should be labled or color coded in some way ![[Screenshot 2024-07-17 021315.png]]










Site surveys:
this helps determine existing wireless landscape 
- Heat maps identify wireless signal strengths 
- Allows you identify all existing access points even some you might not control
- allows you to work around existing frequencies 
- You may want to do this every once and a while in case stuff changes









Audit and assessment report:
This validates our existing security policies to make sure we are following our own rules

- Internal audits are self-imposed checks where we our own company checks that we are following our rules 
- External audits is when a third party performs the check



Baselines:
These give us a point of reference on what is normal so that we can see if somethings normal
- made from past data 
- Can help make predictions on future
