Wireless Networking (801.11) 
- Managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN standards committee 
- This is the Wi-Fi Trademark




802.11a:
- this was one of the Original 802.11 Wireless standard
- This operates in the 5 GHz range 
- 54 megabits per second
- Smaller Range than 802.11b 
- Not commonly seen today



802.11b:
- The other Original 802.11 standard
- operates at 2.3 GHz range
- 11 megabits per second
- better range then 802.11a 
- More frequency conflict but less absorption problems
- Not commonly seen today



802.11g:
- An upgrade to 802.11b 
- Operates in the 2.4 GHz range
- 54 megabits per second 
- Backwards-compatible with 802.11b
- Same problems as 802.11b





802.11n (Wi-Fi 4):
- Update to 802.11g, and 802.11a
- Operates at 5GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
- 600 megabits per second at max
- 802.11n uses MIMO (Multiple-input Multiple-output), This increases the number of antennas to be able to send and receive more information 





802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5):
- Improved on 802.11n
- Operates in 5GHz Only (Up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth)
- Increased channel bonding 
- Denser Signaling modulation meaning you can send alot more info in a shorter amount of time
- New version of MIMO called MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO) you can have up to Eight downlink streams 
- Nearly 7 Gigabits per second at max





802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)
- This is the successor to 802.11ac
- Operates at 5 GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
- 1201 megabits per second per channel and you can have 8 bi-direction MU-MIMO stream so it fast
- This wireless technology is designed for high density environments and it uses a new signaling technology which is very efficient as sending to a large number of people at the same time called Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiple access (OFDMA) which works similar to cellular communication and works well in high Radio wave environments
