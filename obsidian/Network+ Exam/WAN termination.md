Demarcation point:

If you are using services from a WAN provider or a internet service provider ISP. There needs to be a physical location that destines the connection point between the providers network and your internal network. We refer to this location as the Demarcation point 
or the demarc
This Demarc might be a location thats connected to your home for example you could have a telephone box and that box could be the demarc. In a company theres usually a location inside of the building thats considered the demarc point. Usually everyone knows where the Demarc is and when some needs to install a new WAN connection they are sent to the room that we consider the DMARC room 
The location of this demarc is important, especially when problems are occurring so you can tell whether the problem is your ISP/WAN providers fault or your networks fault. 
Usually if its on your side since you have all your own network equipment we refer to this equipment as Customer Premises Equipment or CPE or often referred to as the Customer prem this is where you would connect to do your troubleshooting. If you can connect to the providers side of the demarc and perform all the same test and still have a problem then you  know the issue is somewhere on the providers side.



Smartjack:

It is obviously much easier for a provider if they don't actually have to go into the physical DMARC location in ur office. Often they will put in specialized equipment that they can control remotely this is often referred to as a smartjack. This is technically a Network Interface Unit or NIU. You will see these on the wall and they will usually have blinking lights and status lights. usually in a locked container because this is owned by the network provider.

This is a powered system that is monitoring and is able to provide diagnostics remotely so the provider can log into the smartjack and perform their own loopback tests  and determine if the problems that are occurring are our fault or theirs.
