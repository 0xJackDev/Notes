Site resiliency
- This is where you have a separate physical site you can go to in case of a problem







Cold Site:
- This is effectively a empty building, only thing here is it supplys you with power
- No hardware, Bring it with you
- No data, Bring it with you
- No people, You need to bring your team to the site 
- Basically this is just a emptey room you can use for Recovery






Hot site:
- This is basically the direct opposite of a cold site
- This is a exact replicate of your data center, with duplicate hardware and data
- Often stocked with the same hardware as your data center and when purchasing you auto buy two of the hardware for the Hot site too
- There should be a Fast data link between Hot site and your data center and applications and software should be constantly updated with automated replication of data from Data center to hot site
- It should be flip a switch and everything is ready to be switched to the hot Site









Warm site:
- This is somewhere in between cold and hot site
- Just enough equipment to get going but it is a cheaper alternative to a Hot site
- Might be a big room with rack space where you bring the hardware 
- Or maybe you already have hardware ready and all you need to bring is your software and data 








Cloud site:
Instead of moving to a physical location you may want to consider moving everything to a cloud recovery site.
- Most cloud providers have instant processes to move applications or data into the cloud so this can be very easy 
- No separate facility to manage 
- Online configuration
- Costs can be a flat fee but usually based on use
- The data and application still need to be moved and setup in the cloud site.
