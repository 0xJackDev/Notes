If you are physically connecting to a network and your not using copper then you are probably using fiber optics. This is network communication using Light to communicate instead of electric signals. Meaning theres no RF signal. and because we are communicating with light we can send this signal over very long distances. Fiber optics is also immune to radio interference since it doesnt operate on any radio frequency so it works perfect in environments where copper couldnt be used


Fiber communication:







Multimode Fiber:
This is usually for short range communication up to 2 km 
Often uses LED as the light source 
We call this multimode fiber because the core of the fiber itself is larger then the wavelength of light thats going through it and youll find the light is going through multiple "modes" from one side to the other 



Single-mode fiber:
Long range communication 
this has a smaller core then multimode and only allows one mode of light 
More expensive
