Mobile devices are common referred to as cell phones. 

The reason for this is because we are separated our Land geography into multiple "cells", and we place an antenna where those cells meet and we are sending all of that communication across that particular area across that antenna.


When we first introduced Cellular networks we had

The 2G standard:
There was One standard called GSM - Global System for Mobile communications 
And another standard called CDMA - Code division Multiple access
- This has very poor data support, these networks were originally for voice support but then we found out we can use this for data and made some minor upgrades for packet-switching and sending of IP data

During this time we were during with 2 very different standards in the industry the first being 


GSM:
- Global System for Mobile communications, 
- This was a mobile networking standard brought from the EU 
- This covered  90% of the market and was used in many places around the world
- This is used by T-Mobile and AT&T use this GSM standard to be able to take one SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card from one phone and move it to another phone and your Subscription would move between phones
- The original GSM standard uses multiplexing so multiple users can communicate to a single tower over a single set of frequencies. (multiplexing is a method of combining signals into a single transmission medium) GSM would combine many different people sending data over multiple signals into one big signal 


The competing standard was 

CDMA:
Code division Multiple access 
- Instead of using multiplexing it used a code to be able to send multiple amounts of data at the same time, and you could filter out your data by filtering out the code on the other side 
- Used by Verizon and Sprint but that's really the only people who use this 






3g technology:
- Introduced in 1998 This is the 3rd Generation of mobile networks called 3g
- This upgraded data connectivity over 2g 
- Improved speed 
- Allowed GPS connectivity, Mobile TV, Video calls and more







4G and LTE:
Long term Evolution (LTE)
Eventually we needed a way to merge together those two very different standards and we did this we 4g and LTE 
- This allows us to converge the standards of GSM and CDMA providers into a single shared standard 
- Increased the total number of bandwidth available to a max of 150 megabits a second  

There's a better version of LTE called LTE-A or LTE advanced which made the Download rates of 300 Mbit/s






5g:
- released in 2020
- Makes WAYY FASTER eventually will be 10 gigabits per second but rn its more like 1 gig a second
- This is a significant IoT impact is makes Cell networks speeds more like a LAN
