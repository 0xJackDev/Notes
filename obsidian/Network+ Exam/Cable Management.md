There is a well designed way to manage Cable Infrastructure. Theres usually in a office gonna be a floor of users and either by the walls, floor, or roof there will be cables ran to a closet and in that closet there's usually a patch panel. Those wires from the desk are then punched down into that patch panel using something like a 110 block. Then on the other side of that [[Patch panel ]]is commonly a Rj-45 connector and that RJ-45 connector allows us to plug in from the users desk and extend that connection into switches that we might also have in that same closet, One of the keys with this design is that the wire with the desk Will allows connect to the 110 block and once you do all this connecting you should never need to touch that wire again. All wiring changes should occur on the other side For example. If you wanted to move one connection from one switch to another  you simply move the RJ45 connection to plug into another switch. ![[Screenshot 2024-07-04 011132.png]]





Copper Patch Panel / Patch Bay:

Patch Panels can have RJ45 on one side and Punch-down connection on the other. Or the patch panel might have punch down connections on both sides. 
This allows you to be able to move a connection around by switching different switch interfaces rather than changing any wires that go back to the desk 







Fiber Distribution Panel:

we don't tend to run Fiber connections from someone's desk due to the Expenses associated with installing fiber. But we will commonly run fiber between floors of a building or between separate buildings themselves. On both sides of this fiber run we will often install a Fiber Distribution Panel.
that's because we rather run a single pair of fiber between connections if we are going through all that cost we generally will want to run multiple fibers at a time. There's loops inside  these panels as there's a max bend radius you have to associate with fiber optics and you cant bend the cables too tight so you use large loops. There's often a fair bit of extra fiber so you can move around the panel. 





One you start connecting and using different types of patch panels, you'll notice that some patch panels are using different blocks to be able to punch down those wires. One of the very early types of common blocks is a 66 block 


66 Block:
A 66 block is commonly used for Analog voice communication 
Left side is patched to the right 
You need a wire and a Punch down tool for this no more tools.
This is generally replaced by 110 blocks





110 block
This is a wire to wire patch panel
No intermediate interface required
Supports Category 5 and Cat 6 cables
Wires are "punched" into the block the connecting block is on top
Additional wires punched into connecting block 
Patch the top from top to bottom ![[Screenshot 2024-07-04 011132 1.png]]






Krone Block:
this is an alternative to the 110 block which is very common in Europe ![[Screenshot 2024-07-04 012128.png]]
