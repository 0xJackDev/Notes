UPS: Uninterruptible power supply: 
- these cover short term backup power
- There's different UPS types 
- Offline/Standby UPS, These are very common in the home and they will always have the batteries charged and if it notices the main power isn't available it switches to battery power
- Line-interactive, These does the same thing but the switching between Main power to battery power is quicker and this has surge protection
- On-Line/Double-conversion UPS, This is where you are always getting power from the inverter side of the UPS so when you do lose power, no switching over has to happen.
- UPS have more features then just power, They can have auto shutdown, outlets, and phone line suppression







Power Distribution Units (PDUs):
- This provides multiple power outlets usually in a rack, a extension cord with multiple outlets for example
- Often include monitoring and power control








Generators:
- UPSs will run out of spare battery eventually, for permanent Long-term power Backup you may want to consider using a generator
- Fuel Storage is required
- This can power an entire building






HVAC, Heating ventilation and Air-conditioning:
- Since computers create a lot of heat HVACs really important 
- This is a very complex task 
- You should also have a central PC t hat is able to manage HVAC systems 











Fire suppression:
- Data center fire safety 
- Water isn't always to best suppression option
- Instead inert gasses and chemical agents remove the oxygen from the air and then get rid of the fire
- Often integrated into a HVAC system
