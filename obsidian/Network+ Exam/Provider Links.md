We often think about connecting to the internet using a local wireless connection or a wired ethernet cable, but you can also connect to the internet using satellite networking 

-Satellite networking connectivity communicates into space to a satellite and back down to earth again to provide your internet connections. This is a relatively high cost because of all of the equipment used but you can get pretty good bandwidth connections. 

-High Latency
- High Cost
- High frequencies - 2 GHz, This has problems during rain storms



Copper: 

On most of our ethernet networks we are using copper to connect our network together. These are relatively inexpensive to connect inside of a building. 

- Limited bandwidth
- Common to see On Wide Area Networks (WANs) 
- Often combined with Fiber, Where you are using Copper on our local loop (Home network) and within the providers network you would see fiber used 
-


DSL (digital subscriber line)
Often this actually is ADSL for (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ) Because the speeds coming into our homes are different then the bandwidths and speeds available going out of our network therefore its asymmetric. 
DSL uses the telephone lines that we already have inside of our homes and businesses to provide this connectivity.
With DSL there is usually a limitation concern you cannot be more then 10,000 foot from the Central Office (CO)

Closer to the CO = Faster





Cable Broadband

Another popular copper connections for internet connectivity is a cable modem we call this broadband because the signals inside that coax connection are being communicated across many different frequencies or a broad number of bandwidths there are many different traffic types inside of these coaxs there may be digital TV, VOIP Etc.

You may notice that the specifications for your cable modem have a specific standard called DOCSIS this is (data over cable service interface specification ) and this is the type of connectivity that that is used by this cable modem. Depending on the version used in your cable network you may see speeds of 50 - 1000 mb/s 
-This is high speed! 





Fiber
This gives HIGH speed data communication over frequencies over lights
Fiber networks are more expensive to repair and to install. 
This is very common to see Internet service providers to use fiber in the core of their networks as it does provide so much speed. this is where you see thigs like SONET rings and Wavelength Division multiplexing, Or WDM .
My network at home uses fiber too :3 




Metro ethernet:
If you are part of a company in a city you can usually connect your locations together using Metro Ethernet. This is a type of connectivity used in a small geographical area but allows you to connect to these quick.
Another good part is that it is ethernet
