Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):
This is sometimes called Hardware as a Service (HaaS):
This is the outsourcing of equipment, you are still responsible for managing the application, security, and data. Sometimes that might include the OS not always though. 
Your data is out there but more within your control 





Software as a service (SaaS):
In this you don't have to create software, manage infrastructure, or manage hardware. There's no 
local installation either. 
Say you have a third party payroll system that would be a SaaS.
Central management of data and applications. 
your data is out there
You as the user has to do no dev work

Google mail, Office 365




Platform as a service (PaaS):
You can kinda think of this as a middle ground between SaaS and IaaS. This is a cloud based system someone else is managing.
You dont have to worry about managing your data center or anything but you can instead login to your thing and do what you want but the system is already setup for you. 
Its very common for the platform as a service provider to give you Building blocks to do something, Sites like WIX are a example of this 





If you install your own data center with your own equipment running your own applications then that is considered ON Premises ![[Screenshot 2024-07-15 000551.png]]






There's different models you can use to rollout these models ![[Screenshot 2024-07-15 000646.png]]





Desktop as a Service

DaaS 
this gives you a local Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) with a virtual machine in the cloud you can do whatever with. Say you have a bunch of Minimal systems with Low operating power you could just have those connect to the DaaS with powerful computers. However one significant setback is network connectivity
