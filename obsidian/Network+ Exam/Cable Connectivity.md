Speed 
- Theoretical max data rate



Throughput:
- This is the amount of data that can be transferred in a given timeframe
- Usually measured in bits pers econd





Distance:
- Know the maximum Distance of the cable
- Varies based on copper, fiber, repeaters, etc





Unshielded and Shielded cable


-U = Unshielded 
-S = Braided Shielding 
-F = Foil SHielding 




We Label this somewhere on the cable often as 

(Overall Cable) / (individual pairs) TP 

So if you had Foil shielding on the cable and Braided Shielding on the Cables it would be 

F/STP




Plenum refers to if there is a shared airspace for in the roof, for example if there is plenum there's shared airspace for the Air return.

If there's a fire and your network cables are up in a No plenum environment youll be fine because there's no oxygen 

If we are using a Network connection through a Plenum roof we have to use a Plenum rated cable because it will have minimal amount of smoke and fumes to add to the airspace




Plenum rated cable:
- Traditional Network cables are surrounded by a cabled jacket made of Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)
- A fire rated Cable jacket will be made up of Fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or Low-smoke PVC 
- Plenum rated/ Fire rated cables arent as flexible






Serial Console Cables:
- There's many different kind of ports for Console connectors but the most common are DB-9 and DB-25
- Used for modems, printers, mine and networking 
- This is now gonna be used as a configuration/management port 






Rollover cable:
- With A lot of Cisco devices you'll find instead of using a serial connection you will use a Rollover cable 
- Cisco Console cable/ Yost Cable
- This is a standard that allows RJ-45 connection to be able to manage the switch or router connections on a management port. 
- Used in conjunction with Serial Console cables 
- If you see a Rj-45 Port with CONSOLE on it, then thats a rollover cable





Ethernet Cross-over cable:
This connects two ethernet devices without using a switch, instead use your crossover cable
