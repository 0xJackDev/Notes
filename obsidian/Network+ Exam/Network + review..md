Dynamic NAT
Unlike static NAT. which provides one-to-one mapping between a private and public IP addresses, dynamic NAT assigns a public IP address to a private IP address only when there is outbound traffic.
- Used in large networks where multiple devices need internet access at the same time but public IP addresses are limited


change management process.
1. Change Request: identify the need for change and submit format request
2. Impact assessment: evaluating the potential impact and feasibility of the proposed change
3. Approval: obtaining necessary Approval from stakeholders 
4. Planning: Develop a detailed plan to implement the change
5. Implementation: Executing the change according to plan
6. Testing: verifying that the change has been implemented correctly and functions as intended
7. Review: Assessing the change to ensure it meets the desired outcomes and documenting lessons learned
8. Closure: Finalizing the change process and updating documenation


|**S.No.**|**ENCAPSULATION**|**DECAPSULATION**|
|---|---|---|
|1.|The data moment starts from the upper layer and terminates finally on the lowest layer.|Whereas, here the data moves from the lower layer till the upper layer.|
|2.|The process involves addition of header and trailer section.|This process involves removal of header and trailer sections|
|3.|This process executes first and is followed by decapsulation.|This process executes once encapsulation is finally completed.|
|4.|It occurs inside the source device.|It occurs inside the destination device.|

 bare-metal virtualization environment?
- a  bare-metal virtualization environment also known as a hypervisor-based or type 1 hypervisor environment is a setup where the hypervisor is installed directly on the physical hardware of the host machine, bypassing the need for a host machine with a host operating system. This allows for efficient and direct management of hardware resourced to create and run multiple VMs
- VMware ESXi is a example of this as well as Microsoft Hyper-V can be used for this.


CompTIA troubleshooting methodology?
- **Identify the Problem**:
    
    - Gather information from the user or from error messages.
    - Identify symptoms and ask questions to understand the issue.
    - Determine if anything has changed recently in the environment.
- **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**:
    
    - Question the obvious and consider multiple possible causes.
    - Use your knowledge and experience to hypothesize potential reasons for the problem.
- **Test the Theory to Determine the Cause**:
    
    - Test the most likely cause first.
    - If the theory is confirmed, move to the next step.
    - If the theory is not confirmed, develop a new theory and test it.
- **Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem and Implement the Solution**:
    
    - Create a plan that addresses the root cause.
    - Consider potential impacts of the solution on other systems or users.
- **Verify Full System Functionality and, if Applicable, Implement Preventive Measures**:
    
    - Ensure that the problem is resolved and that the system is fully operational.
    - Test the system to confirm functionality.
    - Implement measures to prevent the issue from recurring.
- **Document Findings, Actions, and Outcomes**:
    
    - Record the details of the problem, the steps taken to resolve it, and the final outcome.
    - Documentation helps in future troubleshooting and can assist other technicians facing similar issues.

The difference between a stateless and stateful firewall is a stateful firewall monitors the state of connections and makes decisions based on context while stateless usually are dumb and just block by port.


A stateful firewall can keep track of Sender and Destination IP addresses and determine what traffic is legit.

### Syslog Severity Levels:

Syslog defines eight severity levels for log messages, ranging from most severe to least severe:

1. **Emergency (0)**: System is unusable.
2. **Alert (1)**: Immediate action is needed.
3. **Critical (2)**: Critical conditions.
4. **Error (3)**: Error conditions.
5. **Warning (4)**: Warning conditions.
6. **Notice (5)**: Normal but significant conditions.
7. **Informational (6)**: Informational messages.
8. **Debug (7)**: Debug-level messages.
