Fiber
LOCAL CONNECTOR
LC
One popular fiber optic connector is an LC or Local Connector this cable has two different fibers inside of it. Usually for sending fore receiving. These connectors are pretty small

Fiber
Straight tip Connector
ST connector 
Some connectors that are slightly larger than the LC are the ST connectors or the Straight tip connectors. These connectors lock in place with bayonet connectors where you screw them in.![[Screenshot 2024-07-03 213031.png]]




Fiber
Subscriber connector 
SC 
These are square connectors sometimes people think SC stands for square connector. When plugging these in they may be connected individual or Plugging into two fibers in the same device.

Mechanical Transfer Registered Jack
MT-RJ

This is the final Fiber connector and it is also the cheapest If a manufacturer is trying to have the largest amount of cables in a small place this is prolly the cable they will use ![[Screenshot 2024-07-03 213440.png]]






UPC and APC 



This has the deal with the physics of controlling light and using light for data. One very important statistic is the Return loss and that is the light that is reflected back to the source thereby creating an inefficacy in the amount of light you can send to the other side.  To be able to minimalize this we have different connectors we may use one of these is a


UPC or a (Ultra Polished Connector):
this is is ferrules are connecting at a 0-degree angle and they are facing each other directly, this type of connector has a high return loss 
One type of connector that has a lower return loss is

APC or a (Angle Polished connector )
this is where the ferrules end-face radius polish is at a 8-degree angle instead of 0 this has a Loser return loss but generally higher insertion loss than UPC ![[Screenshot 2024-07-03 213921.png]]







Copper/ Ethernet Cables




RJ11 connector 

This is a registered Jack type 11
this is a 6 position connector but only 2 conductors this is sometimes written as 6p2c
RJ14 uses 6P4C for Dual-line use but it is commonly refered to as RJ11 too 

This is typically used for analog telephone connections or DSL (digital subscriber) connections 




RJ45 Connector 

Registered Jack type 45

RJ45 is much larger then RJ11.

this is a 8 position 8 conductor 8P8C

This is always what we use for ethernet  and it is a a modular connector, sometimes its hard to tell between RJ45 and RJ11 but the size is very different 



If you are using a cable modem then you are problem connecting using a coax connecter from the company this coaxial connector is called an F-connector this is the cable you will see on a Cable modem and it follows the DOCIS or (Data over cable Service Interface specification) standards many types this is a RG-6 cable and the thing at the end is a threaded cable.
