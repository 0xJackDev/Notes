There are three ways to style react components with CSS this doesnt include frameworks like tailwind CSS



External CSS styling is just applying the styles inside of the index.css file. 




Module CSS is when you create a individual stylesheet for each component Some devs like to create a new folder for each component and in that folder would be Button.jsx and button.module.css inside of the button folder 

so for button we will call it button.module.css

then inside of button.jsx we need to  import this module so at the top of button.jsx do this

then theres inline css.
