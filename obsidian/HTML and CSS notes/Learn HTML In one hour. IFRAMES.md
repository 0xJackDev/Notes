IFRAMES allow you to embed web page and other documents within your website.

An iframe is used to embed content from another source into a HTML document, This is used for ads and used in many hacking techniques .



Basically using a iframe we can embed a webpage with another webpage.



Heres how we create an iframe.

Its a self closing tag.



Alot of major websites have disabled the use of Iframe so you cant for example embed a banking website login and then pose as that banking website.




This embeddes a IP torrenting viewer with iframe

<iframe src="https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/en/peer/" width="750" height="750">


and we can do the exact same thing to add an html document and just instead of the src= to the webpage make the src= to the name of the file so src=*nameofhtmlfile.html*





Iframes have a border. to get rid of that to style="border:0" to have no border
