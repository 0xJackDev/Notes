first lets get some icons from 
https://fontawesome.com/

There should be a kit we need to find the link and place it in the head of our HTML document. 

<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/d48ab3861a.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


then just find a icon you like and copy and paste it for example. 
<i class="fa-brands fa-hackerrank"></i>
