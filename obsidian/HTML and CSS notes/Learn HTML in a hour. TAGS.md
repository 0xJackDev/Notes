Html documents should start with 

<!DOCTYPE html> To comply with basic HTML standards, this lets the visitors web browser know that this is an HTML5 document.



Following this text we will create a pair of HTML tags 


	<html> 

	</html>

Tags are the keywords inside angle brackets "<>" that a webpage uses to define how your web browser will display and form content , usually these come in pairs so we will need an opening html tag and closing html tag. All of our HTML code will be within these html tags. 

The HTML element represents the root of an HTML document, There is two majors sections Head, and Body.


Lets create a pair of Head tags 

	<head>
	
	</head


Head represents information about a webpage, and there is also 

	<body>

	</body>

The body tag represents what you would like to display to the user, while the head is information about the web page 



<!DOCTYPE html>

  

<html>

  

<head>

    <title>

        My First Website

    </title>

</head>

  

<body>

    I Love George Lopez

</body>

  
  
  
  
  

</html>


If you Click on I love George Lopez it shows the HTML code needed to have a webpage display this. We can use 


	<h1>  I Love George Lopez</h1>  to make the text bigger

h1 is the largest header tag h2 is smaller h3 is smaller h4 is even smaller and so on so fourth. 

this just makes it a header.


So if you need a title for your webpage you can always play some text within a pair of h1 header tags 



Paragraph elemeents are made of

	p tags <p> </p>

Browsers automatically add a blank line before and after Paragraph elements, also if we need some longer sample text we can type lorem and it will generate text.


If you would like to add a line break just add a br element.


take this code here, Click on to view

<!DOCTYPE html>

  

<html>

  

<head>

    <title>

        My First Website

    </title>

</head>

  

<body>

    <h1> I Love George Lopez</h1>

    <h2>  I Love George Lopez</h2>

  
  
  
  
  

</body>

  
  

</html>



Say i wanted to space out these header tags, well i can add a line break with br tag, and there is no closing line for this 
<!DOCTYPE html>

  

<html>

  

<head>

    <title>

        My First Website

    </title>

</head>

  

<body>

    <h1> I Love George Lopez</h1>

    <br>

    <br>

    <br>

  

    <h2>  I Love George Lopez</h2>

  
  
  
  
  

</body>

  
  

</html>





Theres also a hr element, this means Horizontal rule. If you ever need to divide your page section by section. You can always add a Horizontal rule.


Lets say we have a title to this webpage and i want to divide the title from the body I would just do 


<!DOCTYPE html>

  

<html>

  

<head>

    <title>

        My First Website

    </title>

</head>

  

<body>

    <h1> This is my website</h1>

    <hr>

    i love george

  
  
  
  
  

</body>

  
  

</html>
