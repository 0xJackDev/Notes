we need webm file .ogg file or mp4 file 


within our html file we will need a video element with src attribute to where the file of the video is  


	<video src="run.mp4">

we can also use other attributes like width and height. and we will need controls to play the video so add controls

	<video controls src="run.mp4" width="200">
</video>


we can set this to autoplay instead of controls if we want it to play in the background.

theres also, muted, loop and more attributers
