the <meta > element represents various kinds of metadata that cannot be expressed using the title, base, link, style and script elements.



Metadata is data about other data.


With the meta tags we place them within the head of our HTML document, not the data. So with this we can tell the body some information about our webpage. Meta tags are self closing we do not need a closing tag. 




Metatags also have a name attribute we can set to one of many settings. For example if we wanted metadata for a description of our webpage inside of <head> tags we could add <meta name="description" content="This is a website and it does this">. 


This is one example of a metatag.

Another good thing is  keywords for SEO so 

<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, WEBSITE, KEYWORD">



We can add a author of the website and more. 




If you want your website to be able to be viewed on someones mobile device and automatically sized their screen to the mobile device do this.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 


Allows u to scale to mobile device


Another meta tag is a charset. for example

<meta charset="UTF-8"> 
tells you which encoding you are using like Unicode/ ASCII.



We can also make our Website refresh after a given number of seconds 
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"
