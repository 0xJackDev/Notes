Semantic tags keep content organized for Search Engine Optimization

<header> Introduction content
<nav> Navigation bar and links
<main> Main content
<section> Dependent content
<aside>  = side content
<article> Independent Content
<footer> Closing content 



@media screen and (max-width:600px){

    aside, section, article{
