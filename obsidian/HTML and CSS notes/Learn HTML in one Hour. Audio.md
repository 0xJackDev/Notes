After finding a mp3 file or wav file you wanna use to play music on drag it into the folder containg your index.html file 


to add audio to our webapage we need an audio element and list the source equal to the sound file

<audio src="monkeymusic.mp3"> 



This sound audio is a Boolean attribute, meaning true or false. to set it equal to true we need to type the name of the attribute within audio this is called controls 

	<audio controls src="monkeymusic.mp3" >

</audio>


this allows us to play the music, pause it turn it down etc
