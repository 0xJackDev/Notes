a for loop will repeat some code for a limited amount of times.


for(let i = 0; i <= 2; i++){

    console.log('Hi')

}

this will repeat Hi to the console 3 times. 

a for loop in javascript is JUST like in C++ 

to make it so it increments by 2 instead of jsut 1 we can do 

for(let i = 0; i <= 2; i+=2){

    console.log('Hi')

}



continue; skips an iteration of the loop.  Meaning if you put continue in your for loop it will skip all the code that comes after it and repeat it again. 


break; breaks out of a loop completely.
