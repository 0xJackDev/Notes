the .checked property determines the check state of an HTML checkbox or a radio button element. By examining this property we can determine if a check box is checked or a radio button is selected.


to create a checkbox in html do    
<input type="checkbox" id="mycheckbox">


to create a radio element do     <input type="radio" id="visabtn">


with radio buttons they should all be in the same group so that you can make sure you can only select one button at a time. we will group them using the name= attribute.
