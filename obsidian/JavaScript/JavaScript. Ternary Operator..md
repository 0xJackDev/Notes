this is a shortcut to if and else statements that helps to assign a variable based on a condition the Ternary operator is ? or question mark.

to write a if statement with this follow these guidelines 
*condition* ? *codeIfTrue* : *codeIfFalse*



for example lets say we want to check if someones over 18 

let age = 21;

age >= 18 ? console.log('You are old enough') : console.log('Too young');
This would log to the console that you are old enough
