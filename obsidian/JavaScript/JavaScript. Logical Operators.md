Logical operators are used to combine or manipluate boolean values 


There is three of them

AND = && 

OR = || 

Not = ! 


the && makes it so both if statements need to be true.

if(temp > 0 && temp <= 30){

    console.log(' the weather is good');

}

else{

    console.log(' the weather is bad');

}

for example for the if statement to execute the temp must be greater then 0 AND less then or equal to 30.


The ||. OR logical operator executes the if statement IF ONE of the statements is true.




Using the NOT operator we can flip a Boolean to true to false or False to True.


For example 


const isSunny = true;

  

if(!isSunny){

    console.log('it is cloudy');

}else{

    console.log('it is sunny');

}


the !iSunny is basically asking. if it is NOT sunny. The ! operator will turn false to true and True to False.
