Math is a built in javascript object that provides a built in collection of properties and methods. For example if you ever need the value of you would type.

Math.PI; 



if you would like to round something use the Math.round(); function and place the variable you want to round inside of the function.




there is also Math.floor() which always rounds down. 


theres also Math.trun(); which will elimate any decimal portion without rounding


another way to put something to the power is to use the Math.pow(); function. This has two parameters the first being the number and the second being to the power of second variable 


there is also a Math.sqrt(); function which finds the square root of a number.


If you ever need to find the natural logerithm of a function you can use the Math.log(); function



if you need to do anything for Trigonometry there is the Math.sin(); function. Inside of this function you will place radiants 

Math.cos(); is another function for trig


Math.tan(); is another function for trig.



to find the absolute value of a number you can use the Math.abs(); function. for example say theres a negative number it will return the value in positive for example -3 will be 3 because the absolute value is 3 away from 0.



to find the sign of a number you can use the Math.sign(); function if its a negative number the result will be -1 if its positive it will be 1 and if its 0 it will be 0 




we can find the max or min value from a set of variables 

let x = 3;

let y = 2;

let z = 1;

  
  

let max = Math.max(x,y,z);

console.log(max);


this will return 3. min works the same way. Make sure you separate the variables with a comma. 


which is Math.min();
