1. Upon runtime I would like the program to delay slightly and maybe trigger a GUI, maybe act this a game cheat or whatever I want it to on run download a stager which is automatically loaded, in the background and then after a jitter amount of time (30 seconds) download the malware and load it into memory then decrypt it using the private keys stored inside stager. I want to bypass Windows defender if possible
2. Report Back to C2 with machine usernames. What permissions its running under i.e (admin, username) and the IP address of the user who is connecting back. Also maybe query some more information like is in VM, if its joined to a domain or workgroup and if it has anything other than windows defender maybe
3. On runtime After reporting back to my C2 I would like stage 2 to trigger which Grabs all session and saved passwords from browsers. Also adding it to my list of active infected cities
4. Maintain Persistence by adding registry keys, Adding itself to startup and maybe migrating to a trusted process. Maybe even loading a kernel driver eventually. BYOD (Bring your own driver)




I want to be able to send Requests to all of the machines at once from my c2 (i.e DOS this target)

 I want to be able to target each infected computer individuall (obtain shell, dump sessions, get SAM, LSASS, go dormant for an amount of time?, Enable RDP or some other graphically management )

I want to be able to if this is a domain joined computer be able to pivot throughout the network and use the Infected machine as my internal access to the existing network to compromise it.

I want it to capture NTDS if domain controller or Domain joined
