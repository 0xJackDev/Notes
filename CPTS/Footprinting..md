The enumeration principles are based on some questions that will facilitate all our investigations in any conceivable situation. In most cases, the main focus of many penetration testers is on what they can see and not on what they cannot see. However, even what we cannot see is relevant to us and may well be of great importance. The difference here is that we start to see the components and aspects that are not visible at first glance with our experience.

- What can we see?
- What reasons can we have for seeing it?
- What image does what we see create for us?
- What do we gain from it?
- How can we use it?
- What can we not see?
- What reasons can there be that we do not see?
- What image results for us from what we do not see?

|`Infrastructure-based enumeration`|`Host-based enumeration`|`OS-based enumeration`|

Consider these lines as some kind of obstacle, like a wall, for example. What we do here is look around to find out where the entrance is, or the gap we can fit through, or climb over to get closer to our goal. Theoretically, it is also possible to go through the wall headfirst, but very often, it happens that the spot we have smashed the gap with a lot of effort and time with force does not bring us much because there is no entry at this point of the wall to pass on to the next wall.

These layers are designed as follows:

|**Layer**|**Description**|**Information Categories**|
|---|---|---|
|`1. Internet Presence`|Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.|Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures|
|`2. Gateway`|Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.|Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare|
|`3. Accessible Services`|Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.|Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface|
|`4. Processes`|Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.|PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination|
|`5. Privileges`|Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.|Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment|
|`6. OS Setup`|Identification of the internal components and systems setup.|OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files|


## domain information

Another source to find more subdomains is [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/). This source is [Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency) logs. Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. The standard ([RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962)) provides for the logging of all digital certificates issued by a certificate authority in audit-proof logs. This is intended to enable the detection of false or maliciously issued certificates for a domain. SSL certificate providers like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) share this with the web interface [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), which stores the new entries in the database to be accessed later.


Let us look at what we have learned here and come back to our principles. We see an IP record, some mail servers, some DNS servers, TXT records, and an SOA record.

- `A` records: We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record. Here we only see one that we already know.
    
- `MX` records: The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. Since this is handled by google in our case, we should note this and skip it for now.
    
- `NS` records: These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider.
    
- `TXT` records: this type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such as [SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208), [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489), and [DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376), which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent. Here we can already see some valuable information if we look closer at the results.




Often cloud storage is added to the DNS list when used for administrative purposes by other employees. This step makes it much easier for the employees to reach and manage them. Let us stay with the case that a company has contracted us, and during the IP lookup, we have already seen that one IP address belongs to the `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com` server.

However, there are many different ways to find such cloud storage. One of the easiest and most used is Google search combined with Google Dorks. For example, we can use the Google Dorks `inurl:` and `intext:` to narrow our search to specific terms. In the following example, we see red censored areas containing the company name.

#### Google Search for AWS

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/gsearch1.png)

#### Google Search for Azure

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/gsearch2.png)




Third-party providers such as [domain.glass](https://domain.glass) can also tell us a lot about the company's infrastructure. As a positive side effect, we can also see that Cloudflare's security assessment status has been classified as "Safe". This means we have already found a security measure that can be noted for the second layer (gateway).
## S3 BUCKETS

Another very useful provider is [GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com). We can do many different searches, discover AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud storage, and even sort and filter by file format. Therefore, once we have found them through Google, we can also search for them on GrayHatWarefare and passively discover what files are stored on the given cloud storage.



## FTP

#### Download All Available Files

FTP

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
```





## SMB



Server message block (SMB) is a protocol that regulates access to files and entire direcotries and other network resources like printers, routers, or more interfaces for the network. 

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by `Access Control Lists` (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as `execute`, `read`, and `full access` for individual users or user groups. The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.


## Dangerous Settings

Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. In that case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring with them. Let us take the setting `browseable = yes` as an example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`browseable = yes`|Allow listing available shares in the current share?|
|`read only = no`|Forbid the creation and modification of files?|
|`writable = yes`|Allow users to create and modify files?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`enable privileges = yes`|Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?|
|`create mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?|
|`directory mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories?|
|`logon script = script.sh`|What script needs to be executed on the user's login?|
|`magic script = script.sh`|Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?|
|`magic output = script.out`|Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?|

Let us create a share called `[notes]` and a few others and see how the settings affect our enumeration process. We will use all of the above settings and apply them to this share. For example, this setting is often applied, if only for testing purposes. If it is then an internal subnet of a small team in a large department, this setting is often retained or forgotten to be reset. This leads to the fact that we can browse through all the shares and, with high probability, even download and inspect them.


#### SMBclient - Connecting to the Share

SMB

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
        dev             Disk      DEVenv
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

We can see that we now have five different shares on the Samba server from the result. Thereby `print$` and an `IPC$` are already included by default in the basic setting, as we have already seen. Since we deal with the `[notes]` share, let us log in and inspect it using the same client program. If we are not familiar with the client program, we can use the `help` command on successful login, listing all the possible commands we can execute.


```shell-session
smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes
```



We can see from the results that it is not very much that Nmap provided us with here. Therefore, we should resort to other tools that allow us to interact manually with the SMB and send specific requests for the information. One of the handy tools for this is `rpcclient`. This is a tool to perform MS-RPC functions.

The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.

#### RPCclient

SMB

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $> 
```

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the rpcclient.

|**Query**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`srvinfo`|Server information.|
|`enumdomains`|Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.|
|`querydominfo`|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|`netshareenumall`|Enumerates all available shares.|
|`netsharegetinfo <share>`|Provides information about a specific share.|
|`enumdomusers`|Enumerates all domain users.|
|`queryuser <RID>`|Provides information about a specific user.|

                SID: S-1-1-0
```

These examples show us what information can be leaked to anonymous users. Once an `anonymous` user has access to a network service, it only takes one mistake to give them too many permissions or too much visibility to put the entire network at significant risk.

Most importantly, anonymous access to such services can also lead to the discovery of other users, who can be attacked with brute-forcing in the most aggressive case. Humans are more error-prone than properly configured computer processes, and the lack of security awareness and laziness often leads to weak passwords that can be easily cracked. Let us see how we can enumerate users using the `rpcclient`



## NFS
Commonly used ports are 111 and 2049


Network file system or (NFS) is a network file system deved by Sun microsoftervices. Similar to SMB. However NFS is used between Linux and unix and cannot communicate with NFS
While NFS protocol version 3.0 (`NFSv3`), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with `NFSv4`. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.

|**Version**|**Features**|
|---|---|
|`NFSv2`|It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.|
|`NFSv3`|It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.|
|`NFSv4`|It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol.|

NFS version 4.1 ([RFC 8881](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8881)) aims to provide protocol support to leverage cluster server deployments, including the ability to provide scalable parallel access to files distributed across multiple servers (pNFS extension). In addition, NFSv4.1 includes a session trunking mechanism, also known as NFS multipathing. A significant advantage of NFSv4 over its predecessors is that only one UDP or TCP port `2049` is used to run the service, which simplifies the use of the protocol across firewalls.

## Dangerous Settings

However, even with NFS, some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure. Here are some of them listed:

| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rw`             | Read and write permissions.                                                                                          |
| `insecure`       | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                       |
| `nohide`         | If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry. |
| `no_root_squash` | All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.                                                               |




#### Show Available NFS Shares

NFS

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ showmount -e 10.129.14.128

Export list for 10.129.14.128:
/mnt/nfs 10.129.14.0/24
```

#### Mounting NFS Share

NFS

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ mkdir target-NFS
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.14.128:/ ./target-NFS/ -o nolock
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ cd target-NFS
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ tree .

.
└── mnt
    └── nfs
        ├── id_rsa
        ├── id_rsa.pub
        └── nfs.share

2 directories, 3 files
```

There we will have the opportunity to access the rights and the usernames and groups to whom the shown and viewable files belong. Because once we have the usernames, group names, UIDs, and GUIDs, we can create them on our system and adapt them to the NFS share to view and modify the files.

#### List Contents with Usernames & Group Names

NFS

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ ls -l mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root     1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root      348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 root     root        0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

#### List Contents with UIDs & GUIDs

NFS

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ ls -n mnt/nfs/

total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000 1872 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.priv
-rw-r--r-- 1 1000 1000  348 Sep 25 00:55 cry0l1t3.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0 1000 1221 Sep 19 18:21 backup.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0 1872 Sep 19 17:27 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0  348 Sep 19 17:28 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1    0    0    0 Sep 19 17:22 nfs.share
```

It is important to note that if the `root_squash` option is set, we cannot edit the `backup.sh` file even as `root`.

We can also use NFS for further escalation. For example, if we have access to the system via SSH and want to read files from another folder that a specific user can read, we would need to upload a shell to the NFS share that has the `SUID` of that user and then run the shell via the SSH user.

After we have done all the necessary steps and obtained the information we need, we can unmount the NFS share.

#### Unmounting
MAKE SURE TO 
NFS

```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ cd ..
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ sudo umount ./target-NFS
```



## DNS

|**Server Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DNS Root Server`|The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe.|
|`Authoritative Nameserver`|Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.|
|`Non-authoritative Nameserver`|Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.|
|`Caching DNS Server`|Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.|
|`Forwarding Server`|Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.|
|`Resolver`|Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.|





the network protocol `DNSCrypt` also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.

Many different tools can be used for this, and most of them work in the same way. One of these tools is, for example [DNSenum](https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum).


```shell-session
JackTheWizard@htb[/htb]$ dnsenum --dnsserver 10.129.14.128 --enum -p 0 -s 0 -o subdomains.txt -f /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt inlanefreight.htb
```
