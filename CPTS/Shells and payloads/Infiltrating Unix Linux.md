Considering we can see the system is listening on ports 80 (`HTTP`), 443 (`HTTPS`), 3306 (`MySQL`), and 21 (`FTP`), it may be safe to assume that this is a web server hosting a web application. We can also see some version numbers revealed associated with the web stack (`Apache 2.4.6` and `PHP 7.2.34` ) and the distribution of Linux running on the system (`CentOS`). Before deciding on a direction to research further (dive down a rabbit hole), we should also try navigating to the IP address through a web browser to discover the hosted application if possible.


keeps code for exploit modules in their [repos on github](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/tree/master/modules/exploits). We could do an even more specific search using a search engine: `rConfig 3.9.6 exploit metasploit github`

## Spawning a TTY Shell with Python

When we drop into the system shell, we notice that no prompt is present, yet we can still issue some system commands. This is a shell typically referred to as a `non-tty shell`. These shells have limited functionality and can often prevent our use of essential commands like `su` (`switch user`) and `sudo` (`super user do`), which we will likely need if we seek to escalate privileges. This happened because the payload was executed on the target by the apache user. Our session is established as the apache user. Normally, admins are not accessing the system as the apache user, so there is no need for a shell interpreter language to be defined in the environment variables associated with apache.

We can manually spawn a TTY shell using Python if it is present on the system. We can always check for Python's presence on Linux systems by typing the command: `which python`. To spawn the TTY shell session using Python, we type the following command:

#### Interactive Python

Infiltrating Unix/Linux

```shell-session
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")' 
```
