Step 1.
Learn how to code in 

C, C++, Golang, Rust for your implement good resources for these are


C - Book  C a software engineering approach

C++ - Effective modern C++

Golang - https://gobyexample.com/

Rust - The rust programming language


Step 2.
Develop a basic understanding of Assembly

Great book - Computer Systems: A programmers persepctive

GREAT COURSE
https://apps.p.ost2.fyi/learning/course/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Arch1001_x86-64_Asm+2021_v1/home


OpenSecurityTraining2 is a really good resource for free training



To see what your C++ code or C code will look like in Assembly look at this website
https://godbolt.org/



You can use asembly for good Indirect syscalls and callstack spoofing (learn what those are and provide definition below)

https://github.com/HavocFramework/Havoc/tree/main/payloads/Demon/src/asm

Once you start to get a good understanding of asembly. remember there is different syntax with assembly

intel aka nasm vs at&t syntax


make sure to get comfortable  with x64dbg or winDBG the below teached u winDbg

Step 3:

Understand Windows Internals Fundamentals



After we have finished programming we can move to the core of windows programming.

The primary recommendation for getting into windows internal is read the first 3 chapters of

Windows Internal 7th edition, Part 1. FIRST THREE CHAPTERS ARE MOST IMPORTANT

Read https://github.com/reactos/reactos which is a reverse engineered redo of windows.
https://doxygen.reactos.org/index.html
Say theres a function that allocates memory you learn about. going into react OS's source code to look at this function and what is called can be helpful 


Looking at react Os source code can be helpful while Reverse engineering.

Make sure to follow through on the excersies in the book on windows Internals.

Understand how to answer Windows internal question. Ask where to look. 

How to get started with reverse engineering

1. Get whatever DLL you are intrested in and put it into IDA or Ghidra and make sure symbols are loaded and look at the pseduo is loaded Ghidra is better



For example if you have a question like how does X do Y you need to understand where to look and how to investigate this.




Step 4 IMPORTANT: Read leaked malware source codes


Malware - Start from the entry point and understand
- What is being performed
- Why is it being performed
- Are there other ways to perform the same behavior (Look at REACTOS and reverse the API's being used)

If youve never seen the API used? 
Use this google dork
site:https://learn.microsoft.com "FunctionName"


the best part about leaked source codes is that you can see how REAL malware works 

READ THE FUCKING DOCS!!!



Great resources
There is also linux

Keep in mind there is no reason to reinvent the wheel if it was done 5 years ago. 
Use google translate to translate russian and stuff to english as there may be

Zeus malware is in /Malware and it is a very advanced piece of malware that came out years ago

Step 6: The map is not the territory 


Just because a map says something doesnt mean thats actually the case. EG MSDN (Microsoft documentation) this misses out on ALOTTT of undocumented stuff. The territory is beyond the map of MSDN 



Step 7: Ask better question:

Ask yourself and others better questions and youll get better answers.

To be able to solve something you must be able to know what to ask. First understand what your trying to solve then the end goal. Then ask a question on how to get from that problem to the goal.

"Whoever best describes the problem is the one most likely to solve it"
